I’m an electrical engineering student at the University of Washington excited about embedded electronics and software.

In my current position at the UW Sensor Systems Lab, I work on WISP, a batteryless, RF-harvesting sensor. I’ve gained experience with RF design and testing, along with embedded hardware and software development. Additionally, I created internal software tools that have made it easier to develop and validate the hardware platform. I presented our work on WISP 6.0 at ENSsys 2022 earlier this fall.

Through other experiences, I’ve gained exposure to various fields ranging from cellular communication to acoustics. Through it all, I’ve been part of diverse teams with people from a wide range of disciplines.

I’ve been interested in small-scale aviation for a long time now, and I look fondly back on building my first foam-board RC plane. Since then, I’ve designed and built a few DIY drones as well. While these projects were not rigorous explorations, I was able to dip my toes into some of the electronics and autonomous navigation software.

Thanks for taking the time to consider my application. I’m happy to answer any questions you have and would love the opportunity to interview with you about the position.

Best,  
Rohan Menon
