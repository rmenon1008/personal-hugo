Every few months I feel the urge to completely redo my personal website from the ground up. Each time it has gotten a little closer to how I want my site to function and how I want it to look.

Right now, I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate my site. Compared to my previous WordPress site, I really like having the site's theme, content and rendered pages contained in a single directory.
