This underwater sensor communicates sensor data live using underwater backscatter, enabling a battery life of 2 years of fully-submerged operation. 

Until now, underwater backscatter systems have been limited to short-term laboratory experiments. BlueTag is the first underwater backscatter device to be deployed long enough to sense meaningful environmental data (since July 9th, 2025).

Every 15 minutes, real-time data from the sensor is off-loaded via an underwater backscatter communication link. This sensor data is viewable live [here]("https://sk-exp-server.mit.edu/").
