Houdini Trio is the font used for the headings and path-style text throughout my website. At the moment, it only has the lowercase Latin alphabet along with the forward slash. I’m working on adding numbers and basic punctuation soon.

It’s a tri-space font, meaning that its letters occupy one of 3 possible widths. For example, the ‘i’, ‘d’, and ‘m’ characters occupy small, medium, and large widths respectively.

On the site, it’s used alongside Atkinson Hyperlegible for body text.

## Fofana

Fofana is a highly condensed handwriting font that I designed to be very playful. It is far from complete, with only letters A-Z in upper and lower case available. The kerning needs to be manually adjusted, or if you have the option, use optical kerning. That being said, you can download it here.

## Dini

Dini is a blocky, all caps font. I’ve only created letters A-Z and basic punctuation. Again, it’s really just the letterforms I created. Here’s the download.
