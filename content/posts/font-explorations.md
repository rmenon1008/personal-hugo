Houdini Trio is the font used for the headings and path-style text throughout my website. At the moment, it only has the lowercase Latin alphabet along with the forward slash. I’m working on adding numbers and basic punctuation soon.

It’s a tri-space font, meaning that its letters occupy one of 3 possible widths. For example, the ‘i’, ‘d’, and ‘m’ characters occupy small, medium, and large widths respectively.

On the site, it’s used alongside Atkinson Hyperlegible for body text.
