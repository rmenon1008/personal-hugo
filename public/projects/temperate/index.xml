      <description>Temperate was recently upgraded. While there aren&amp;rsquo;t a ton of cosmetic changes, itâ€™s been largely rewritten behind the scenes. The previous version of Temperate was held together with hope. Just as an example, user settings were shuffled around the app through a convoluted set of exchanges where they were read from local storage, turned into CSS variables, and sometimes re-parsed back into JS variables.
The new app is React-based. While it may be overkill for this application, writing new features and maintaining the app is a lot more fun now.</description>
